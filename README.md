# HLSF Cognition Engine

The HLSF Cognition Engine is a browser-based workbench for analyzing language prompts through recursive token adjacency mapping. It pairs a console-style UI with automated OpenAI-powered pipelines that derive conceptual graphs, extract thematic insights, and rewrite responses based on emergent relationships.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` ‚Äì Static HTML shell that loads the bundled application from Vite.
- `src/` ‚Äì TypeScript sources used to build the interface and runtime logic.
  - `main.ts` bootstraps the application and applies global styling.
  - `app.ts` contains the cognition engine runtime migrated from the original inline script.
  - `styles.css` defines the UI theme and layout.
- `remote-db/` ‚Äì Chunked HLSF adjacency data and metadata used for on-demand hydration.
- `scripts/` ‚Äì Python utilities for processing the exported database snapshots.
- `docs/` ‚Äì Architecture notes and other reference material.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies and start the Vite dev server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:5173` to interact with the engine in development mode.

2. For a production build that can be hosted statically:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The output is written to `dist/`. Serve the directory with any static file server.

3. Alternatively, open `index.html` directly in a modern browser to run the pre-built bundle without the dev server.

When prompted, enter an OpenAI API key (`sk-...`) to enable live calls. Selecting **Continue offline** dismisses the modal and restricts the app to cached or offline behaviors. Keys are stored only in memory.

## SaaS workspace commands

The console can run in a hosted SaaS mode that layers profile management, encryption, and
credit tracking on top of the core cognition features. Profiles own their encryption keys; messages,
ledgers, and decrypt routines are readable only by the active user.

Key commands:

- `/signup <handle> [display name]` ‚Äì Create a new SaaS profile.
- `/switchuser <handle>` ‚Äì Swap the active profile.
- `/plan` ‚Äì Review subscription status, credit balance, and billing schedule.
- `/topup <amount>` ‚Äì Purchase additional LLM API credits using one of the supported tiers.
- `/userlist` ‚Äì Enumerate registered profiles and their credit balances.
- `/message <handle> <text>` ‚Äì Send an encrypted message to another profile; only encrypted blobs are persisted.
- `/inbox` and `/decryptmsg <id>` ‚Äì Inspect encrypted messages and decrypt them within the owning profile.

## Development Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite development server with hot module replacement. |
| `npm run build` | Produce an optimized production bundle. |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally. |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint across the TypeScript sources. |
| `npm run format` | Format TypeScript, CSS, JSON, and Markdown files with Prettier. |

## Remote Database Workflow

Run `python scripts/process_latest_db.py` to generate the chunked adjacency dataset from the latest export. Artifacts are written to `remote-db/` and include `metadata.json`, per-prefix chunks, and a sorted token index.

## Prompt Workflow Highlights

- **Database hand-off.** Loading or importing a database now surfaces the `/db` metadata view and `/help` command output instead of forcing a full HLSF redraw. This keeps the console responsive while still advertising the dataset contents.
- **Context-first prompting.** The engine hydrates only the tokens and adjacencies mentioned in the active prompt, streaming them into the live graph as they arrive. Unknown tokens discovered mid-session animate in real time instead of waiting for a monolithic matrix build.
- **Offline prompt review.** A review panel tracks newly cached tokens, lets you edit adjacency JSON via a ‚úèÔ∏è editor toggle, and exposes üëç/üëé actions so you can commit or discard offline explorations before they update the database.
