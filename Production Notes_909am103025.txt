Production Notes:

After document ingest, in document reflection, present ** bounding tags as bold color. Assign a color based on token context mood.

When choosing a different performance profile, the nodes, edges, and relationships do not change. Please make sure they do.

It seems that the document ingest is not actually pulling content from what I gave it. 

During document ingest, the HLSF seems to easily overload. Gradually load larger sections in batches as there's more nodes, edges, and relationships within the HLSF matrix visualizer.

Loading login button panels takes 5-10 seconds, which is far too long.

Put in functionality for examining an individual cluster within an HLSF. Enable this by changing the zoom so that you can get a micro-level zoom box in clusters. Enable this by changing the zoom so that you can get a micro-level zoom box for clusters. 

What it will be, hopefully. When we process it at high levels and high dimensional relational graphs. It will be emergent without imitation.

Local HLSF AGI chosen responses should be between 1 and 50 words, depending on the choices of the local avatar AGI.

Go back to using the 50 adjacency relationships between tokens. Make it so that any 8 token ingest shall be connected to each other through adjacent tokens. That's it. That's how you create a comprehensive, complete graph for any input so that the HLSF can function properly.

The blur does not fade with the alpha, leaving it on the screen. This is a mistake.
